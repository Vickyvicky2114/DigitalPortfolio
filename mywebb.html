                           <mark> Tiruchirappalli,also called Tiruchi or Trichy, is a major tier II city in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu
                            and the administrative headquarters of Tiruchirappalli district.</mark> The city is credited with being the best livable city, 
                            the cleanest city of Tamil Nadu, as well as the fifth safest city for women in India.It is the fourth largest city as 
                            well as the fourth largest urban agglomeration in the state. Located 322 kilometres (200 mi) south of Chennai and 374 
                            kilometres (232 mi) north of Kanyakumari, Tiruchirappalli sits almost at the geographic centre of Tamil Nadu state. 
                            The Cauvery Delta begins 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) west of the city where the Kaveri river splits into two, forming the 
                            island of Srirangam which is now incorporated into the Tiruchirappalli City Municipal Corporation. The city occupies 
                            an area of 167.23 square kilometres (64.57 sq mi) and had a population of 916,857 in 2011.<br>
                                                                                                                       <br>
                           Tiruchirappalli's recorded history begins in the 3rd century BC, when it was under the rule of the Cholas. The city has also 
                           been ruled by the Mutharaiyars, Pallavas, Pandyas, Vijayanagar Empire, Nayak Dynasty, the Carnatic state and the British. The
                           most prominent historical monuments in Tiruchirappalli include the Rockfort at Teppakulam, the Ranganathaswamy temple at
                           Srirangam dedicated to the reclining form of Hindu God Vishnu, and is also the largest functioning temple in the world, and 
                          the Jambukeswarar temple at Thiruvanaikaval, which is also the largest temple for the Hindu God Shiva in the world. The
                            archaeologically important town of Uraiyur, capital of the Early Cholas, is now a neighbourhood in Tiruchirappalli. 
                            The city played a critical role in the Carnatic Wars (1746–1763) between the British and the French East India companies.<br>
                                                                                                                      <br>
                          The city is an important educational centre in the state of Tamil Nadu, and houses nationally
                           recognized institutions such as National Institute of Technology (NIT), Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Indian 
                          Institute of Information Technology (IIIT) and National Law University (NLU). Industrial units such as Bharat Heavy E
                          lectricals Limited (BHEL), Golden Rock Railway Workshop, Ordnance Factory Tiruchirappalli (OFT) and High Energy Projectile 
                          Factory (HEPF) have their factories in the city. The presence of a large number of energy equipment manufacturing units in 
                          and around the city has earned it the title of "Energy Equipment and Fabrication Capital of India". Tiruchirappalli is
                          internationally known for a brand of cheroot known as the Trichinopoly cigar, which was exported in large quantities to 
                          the United Kingdom during the 19th century.<br>
                                                                      <br>                           
                           A major road and railway hub in the state, the city is served by the Tiruchirappalli International Airport (TRZ) which

    <p> <h2> <u>Etymology: </u> </h2> </p>
                          Historically, Tiruchirappalli was commonly referred to in English as "Trichinopoly". The shortened forms "Trichy" or
                          "Tiruchi" are used in everyday speech and the full name Tiruchirapalli appears in official use by government and quasi-government 
                          offices but seldom used by the general public.
                          According to the late scholar C. P. Brown, Tiruchirappalli might be a derivative of the word Chiruta-palli (lit. "little town")
                          . Orientalists Henry Yule and Arthur Coke Burnell have speculated that the name may derive from a rock inscription carved
                          in the 16th century in which Tiruchirappalli is written as Tiru-ssila-palli, meaning "holy-rock-town" in Tamil.Other 
                          scholars have suggested that the name Tiruchirappalli is a rewording of Tiru-chinna-palli, meaning "holy little town". The 
                          Madras Glossary gives the root as Tiruććināppalli or the "holy (tiru) village (palli) of the shina (Cissampelos pareira)
                          plant".<br>
                                   <br>
                          According to Hindu mythology, Tiruchirappalli derives its name from the three-headed demon Trishira, who meditated on the Hindu god
                          Shiva near the present-day city to obtain favours from the god.An alternative derivation, albeit not universally accepted,
                          is that the source of the city's name is the Sanskrit word "Trishirapuram"—Trishira, meaning "three-headed", and palli or puram meaning
                          "city".

                        Tiruchirappalli Rockfort, locally known as Malaikottai, is a historic fortification and temple complex built on an ancient rock. 
                        It is located in the city of Tiruchirappalli, on the banks of river Kaveri, Tamil Nadu, India. It is constructed on an 83 metres 
                        (272 ft) high rock.There are two Hindu temples inside, the Ucchi Pillayar Temple, Rockfort and the Thayumanaswami Temple, 
                        Rockfort. Other local tourist attractions include the famous Pallava-era Ganesha temple and the Madurai Nayak-era fort. The fort 
                        complex has witnessed fierce battles between the Madurai Nayakas and Adil Shahi dynasty of Bijapur, Carnatic region and Maratha 
                        Imperial forces. The fort played an important part during the Carnatic Wars, helping lay the foundations of the British Empire in
                        India. The Rockfort is the most prominent landmark of the city.The rock is said to be one of the oldest formations in the world. 
                        It is 3.8 billion years old, making it as old as the rocks in Greenland and older than the Himalayas. Quartz, used in glass making,
                         and feldspar, used in ceramics, are found in this rock formation.
                          The Pallavas initially built this temple, but the Nayaks made use of its naturally fortified position and designed it again. 
                         It is a long climb up the 344 steps cut into the stone to the top.
 
                        <h3> <u>Temples:</u> </h3>
                        There are five temples on the rock fort:
                        <ul>
                           <li>the Lalitankura Pallavesvara Griham, also called the Upper Cave,</li> 
                           <li>the Lower Cave,</li>
                           <li>the Manikka Vinayakar temple at the foot of the hill, dedicated to Lord Ganesha,</li>
                           <li>the Ucchi Pillayar Temple at the top of the hill, dedicated to Lord Ganesha</li>
                           <li>the Thayumanaswami Temple, Rockfort, literally "the lord who became the mother",is a large 18th-century temple. 
                            It is dedicated to Shiva, goddess Amman, and there is a shrine for the 18th-century Nayaka-era saint, Tayumanavar.
                             It is on the way, as one climbs the steps to Ucchi Pillayar Temple.</li>

                            Srirangam (Tamil: ஸ்ரீரங்கம்) is a neighbourhood in the city of Tiruchirappalli in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. A river island, Srirangam is bounded 
                            by the Kaveri River on one side and its distributary Kollidam on the other side. Considered as the first among the 108 Divya Desams, a group of Vishnu 
                            temples, it is famous for the Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple, the largest temple complex in India and the biggest functioning Hindu temple in the world. 
                            Srirangam is also home to a significant population of Sri Vaishnavas (followers of Vishnu).<br>
                            <br>
                            Srirangam is famous for its Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple, a major pilgrimage destination for Hindus (especially Sri Vaishnavas) and the largest temple complex in India.
                            According to the UNESCO, Srirangam is considered the biggest functioning Hindu temple in the world,[2] as it covers an area of about 631,000 square metres (6,790,000 sq ft) 
                            with a perimeter of 4 km (10,710 ft),[3] Angkor Wat which is also dedicated to Vishnu is even bigger but services do not take place anymore in the temple.<br>
                            <br>
                            Srirangam is one of a few self-manifested shrines (Svayam Vyakta Kshetras) of Vishnu. The temple complex spans 156 acres (0.63 km2). It has seven 
                            prakaras (enclosures). These enclosures are formed by tall, thick rampart walls running around the sanctum. There are 21 towers, gopurams, in all
                            prakaras decreasing in height inwards. The temple town lies on an islet formed by the rivers Kaveri and Kollidam.The southern gopuram of the temple,
                             called the Rajagopuram, is 239.5 feet tall and, as of 2016, is the tallest in Asia. The construction of the Rajagopuram began during the reign of 
                             Achyuta Deva Raya of the Vijayanagara empire. However, construction was halted after his death and the structure of the Rajagopuram remained 
                             incomplete for over 400 years. The completion of the Rajagopuram was undertaken and completed successfully by Sri Vedanta Desika Yatheendra 
                             Mahadesikan, the 44th jeeyar of Sri Ahobila Matha. The construction spanned 8 years before it was consecrated on 25 March 1987.

                        Arulmigu Sri Mariamman Temple, Samayapuram is an ancient Hindu temple in Tiruchirappalli in Tamil Nadu, India. The main deity, Samayapurathal or 
                        Mariamman, a form of supreme mother goddess Durga or Maha Kali or Aadi Shakthi, is made of sand, clay with extractions of herbs unlike many of the
                         traditional Mariamman deities is considered as most powerful Goddess, and hence unlike many other Hindu deities there are no abhishekams (sacred 
                         bathing) conducted to the main deity, but instead the "abishekam" is done to the small stone statue in front of it.
                         <br> <br>
                         It is believed by the devotees that the Goddess has enormous powers over curing illnesses[1] and hence, it is a ritual to buy small metallic replicas,
                         made with silver or steel, of various body parts that need to be cured, and these are deposited in the donation box.[citation needed]
                         <br> <br>
                        Devotees also offer mavilakku (Tamil - மாவிளக்கு), a sweet dish made of jaggery, rice flour and ghee.[2] Offerings of raw salt is also made to the 
                        Goddess by the rural devotees.The temple attracts thousands of devotees on Sundays, Tuesdays and Fridays, the holy days for Mariamman. Samayapuram
                         is the second most wealthy (in terms of cash flows) temple in Tamil Nadu after Palani.
                         <br> <br>
                         The legacy of Samayapuram is well spread beyond Tamil Nadu and even after centuries of emigrating from India, many people in Sri Lanka, Singapore, 
                         South Africa and Fiji still maintain their loyalties to the temple and try to create similar temples and environment in their new country, raising
                        both a cause of concern and an appreciation of diversity.There is also a Samayapuram Mariamman Temple in Tanjong Rambutan at Malaysia.There is also
                         a shrine for Goddess Sri Samayapuram Mariamman at the Sri Veeramuthu Muneeswarar Temple which is located at Yishun Industrial Park and

    <h3>Trichy In TN Map:</h3>
    <img class="map" src="TNmap.webp">
    <p>Tiruchirappalli is situated in central south-eastern India, almost at the geographic centre of the state of Tamil Nadu.
            The Cauvery Delta begins to form 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) west of the city where the river divides into two streams—the Kaveri 
            and the Kollidam—to form the island of Srirangam.[71][86][87] By road it is 912 kilometres (567 mi) south of Hyderabad, 322 kilometres
           (200 mi) south-west of Chennai and 331 kilometres (206 mi) south-east of Bangalore.[88] The topology of Tiruchirappalli is almost flat
            with an average elevation of 81 metres (266 ft). A few isolated hillocks rise above the surface,[89] the highest of which is the Rockfort;
            its estimated age of 3,800 million years makes it one of the oldest rocks in the world.Other prominent hillocks include 
             the Golden Rock, Khajamalai,and one each at Uyyakondan Thirumalai and Thiruverumbur.<br>
                                                                                                 <br>
          Apart from Kaveri and its tributary Kollidam,the city is also drained by the Uyyakondan Channel,
            Koraiyar and Kudamurutti river channels.The land immediately surrounding the Kaveri River—which crosses
            Tiruchirappalli from west to east—consists of deposits of fertile alluvial soil on which crops such as finger millet and 
           maize are cultivated.Further south, the surface is covered by poor-quality black soil.A belt of Cretaceous rock known as the
            Trichinopoly Group runs to the north-east of the city,and to the south-east there are layers of archaean rocks, granite and gneiss 
             covered by a thin bed of conglomeratic laterite.The region falls under Seismic Zone III, which is moderately vulnerable to earthquake.</p>

            <p>Central Bus Station, popularly known as Central Bus Stand, is one of the bus termini of Trichy, located near Cantonment, the other being the 
             Chatram Bus Stand. The terminus spread over an area of 4.5 acres (1.8 ha) is managed by the Department of Transport (Tamil Nadu). Being a major 
             transit point in the central region of the state,[1] it experiences heavy traffic of about 2,200 buses daily. These buses serve about one lakh 
             (100,000) passengers every day.<br>
                                                <br>
              Due to the strategic location of the terminus within the city and the city within the state, it is quite often to witness heavy traffic particularly 
             during festivals.[11][12] Ever since during the 1990s a proposal for a new integrated bus stand was mooted under the scheme of Integrated Urban Development 
             Programme, small and medium towns (Municipalities and Town Panchayats). Initially about 244.28 acres (98.86 ha) at Panjappur, near NH 45B was identified
             , but was dropped citing as flood prone area. Yet the 100 acres (40 ha) defence land at Mannarpuram was favoured due to its proximity to Tiruchirappalli Junction and within the
              centre of city, but slow response from Ministry of Defence keeps the issue lingering.The fate were same for the site at Ramji Nagar, near NH 45 
              and Kottapattu, near NH 210. The committee which was constituted by the court in 2006 to find an amicable and consensual decision, composed of officials
               from Revenue, Town and Country Planning, Corporation, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board and the Public Works Department, started the process afresh 
               during mid-2011.
